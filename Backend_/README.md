## Deployment Instructions

### ðŸš« Do NOT deploy this backend to Vercel
Vercel is for serverless functions and static sites, not for long-running Express servers. Use one of the following platforms:

---

### ðŸš€ Deploy to Render (Recommended)
1. Go to https://render.com/
2. Click 'New Web Service'.
3. Connect your GitHub repo.
4. Set root directory to `Backend_`.
5. Set build command: `npm install`
6. Set start command: `npm start`
7. Choose a free or paid plan and deploy.

---

### ðŸš€ Deploy to Railway
1. Go to https://railway.app/
2. Click 'Start a New Project'.
3. Connect your GitHub repo.
4. Set root directory to `Backend_`.
5. Deploy.

---

### ðŸš€ Deploy to Heroku
1. Go to https://heroku.com/
2. Create a new app.
3. Connect your GitHub repo.
4. Set root directory to `Backend_`.

---

## Local Development

```bash
cd Backend_
npm install
npm start
```

---

## Environment Variables
- Create a `.env` file in `Backend_` if needed for secrets.
